# monodepth
Pytorch implementation of "Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Left-Right Consistency (Godard, Adoha, Brostow, 2016)". Part of my computer vision final project.

My partner and I extended the paper to concatenate the output of a semantic segmentation model at the second-last output scale. This produced more visually appealing disparity maps.
